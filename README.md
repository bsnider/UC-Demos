#Starting Fresh with JavaScript 4.x Demo Theater samples

[Live Sample](http://bsnider.github.io/UC-Demos/CameraDemo/index.html)

This demo will be used in the Starting Fresh with JavaScript 4.x Demo Theater at the 2016 UC.

## Features

The app is developed with Dojo and jQuery and built on top of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.0](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/), along with [Esri's Calcite Bootstrap framework](http://esri.github.io/calcite-bootstrap/).  


NOTE: Please submit pull requests/issues to update to this sample.  I am always looking for ways to make this sample as useful as possible.
